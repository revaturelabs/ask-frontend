Ask an Expert is an application that allows associates, both in training and in the field, to submit questions about projects they are working on. Associates have the ability to browse topics and tag their questions with the appropriate chip that their quesiton relates to. Internally, the question then routes to an Expert based on their qualifications. AAE generates a queue for experts to pull questions based on the tags and submit responses for the associate. Ultimately, once the question has been answered satisfactorily, the associate can mark the question as closed and future associates can browse these questions for review. AAE allows for associates to quickly and efficiently get their difficult questions answered by professionals they can trust.
